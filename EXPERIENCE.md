# Experience

During this assignment, I explored the concept of vibe coding and modern AI-powered development tools. I learned how AI can assist developers not only by completing code, but also by understanding project context and developer intent.

I created and managed a GitHub repository using a mobile device, which helped me improve my understanding of version control and documentation. Writing the analysis and documentation allowed me to reflect on the strengths and limitations of AI-assisted development.

Overall, this assignment helped me better understand how vibe coding tools can impact the future of software development and improve developer productivity.
